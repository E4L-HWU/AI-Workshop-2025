Welcome to the **AI-Workshop-2025 Repository**! This repository is an extension of the physcial workshop held by Hamze Hammami and E4L.

## üìú Instructions
All workshop instructions and explanations are provided in **AI workshop ppts 2025**. Please refer to these slides for detailed guidance on setting up and running YOLOv8.
follow instructions on 'docs.pdf'
for presentation go to 'pres.pdf'
## üíª Code
All scripts required for training, inference, and evaluation are available in the **`scripts/`** directory.

## üèãÔ∏è Pulling the Model
You can clone the pre-trained model showen in the workshop to play around with directly from **Hugging Face** using:

```bash
 git clone https://huggingface.co/Hamze-Hammami/AI-Workshop-models-E4L
```

Alternatively, you can go directly to the models on **Hugging Face**:

[![Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/front/assets/huggingface_logo-noborder.svg)](https://huggingface.co/Hamze-Hammami/AI-Workshop-models-E4L/tree/main/models)

## üöÄ Running Training Scripts
You can run the training scripts either **locally on a Jupyter Notebook** or on Google Colab:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AJcaxH2Tx6PEU5UHtRBX6ACOhllukigM?usp=sharing)

For local execution, open the script in a notebook:

```python
scripts/train.ipynb
```
