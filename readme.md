Welcome to the **AI-Workshop-2025 Repository**! This repository is an extension of the physcial workshop held by Hamze Hammami and E4L.

## üìú Instructions
All workshop instructions and explanations are provided in **AI workshop ppts 2025**. Please refer to these slides for detailed guidance on setting up and running YOLOv8.
follow instructions on 'docs.pdf'
for presentation go to 'pres.pdf'
## üíª Code
All scripts required for training, inference, and evaluation are available in the **`scripts/`** directory.

## üèãÔ∏è Pulling the Model
You can clone the pre-trained model showen in the workshop to play around with directly from **Hugging Face** using:

```bash
 git clone https://huggingface.co/Hamze-Hammami/AI-Workshop-models
```

Alternatively, you can go directly to the models on **Hugging Face**:

## üöÄ Running Training Scripts
You can run the training scripts either **locally on a Jupyter Notebook** or on Google Colab:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xV9_k9cJPW5G2P5f-6AuRGku20B9Q-Xb?usp=sharing)

For local execution, open the script in a notebook:

```python
code/train.ipynb
```


Thank you to ESSA for making this happen.
